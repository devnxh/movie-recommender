Welcome to the **Movie Recommender System**! This project implements a content-based recommendation engine using cosine similarity. The system suggests movies to users based on the content similarity between the movies.

## Introduction
This project is a content-based movie recommender system. Content-based recommendation systems recommend items by comparing the content of the items (in this case, movies) with a profile of the user's preferences. The system calculates the similarity between different movies using cosine similarity on their content features (like genre, plot, actors, etc.).

## Features
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies similar to the user's favorite movies.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Utilizes cosine similarity to measure the distance between movies based on their content features.
- **Interactive**: Allows users to input their favorite movies and receive recommendations based on their input.

## How It Works
1. **Data Preparation**: 
   - The dataset consists of movie information, such as title, genre, director, plot, etc.
   - Data is preprocessed to extract and combine relevant features into a single feature vector for each movie.

2. **Feature Extraction**: 
   - Text-based features are transformed using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or Count Vectorization.

3. **Cosine Similarity**:
   - The system calculates the cosine similarity between the feature vectors of all movies.
   - Movies with higher similarity scores are considered more similar and thus recommended to the user.

4. **Recommendation**:
   - Based on the similarity scores, the system recommends a list of movies that are most similar to the movies the user likes.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Numpy

You can install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommender-system.git
   cd movie-recommender-system
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the system**:
   ```bash
   python recommender.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the `recommender.py` script.
2. Enter a movie title when prompted.
3. The system will output a list of recommended movies based on the similarity to the entered movie.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about various movies, such as titles, genres, and plots. This data can be found in the `data/` directory of the project. If you wish to use a different dataset, ensure it has similar columns and update the data preprocessing steps accordingly.
